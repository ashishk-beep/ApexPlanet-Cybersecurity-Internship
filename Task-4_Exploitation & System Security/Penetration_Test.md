# Web Application Penetration Test Report

## 1. Engagement Overview

Detail                    | Description
--------------------------|--------------------------------------------
Target Operating System   | Ubuntu Server (VMware Fusion)
Target Application        | DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
Web Server                | Apache2
Attacker Machine          | Kali Linux (VMware Fusion)
Network Type              | Host-Only Private Lab Network
Assessment Type           | Internal Web Application Assessment
Overall Risk Rating       | High

Objective:
To identify and exploit web application vulnerabilities in DVWA and assess their impact on the Ubuntu host system.

---

## 2. Network Configuration

Both Kali Linux and Ubuntu were configured under VMware Fusion using a Host-Only Adapter.

Attacker IP: 192.168.**.X  
Target IP: 192.168.**.Y  

Connectivity Verified Using:
ping <target-ip>

---

## 3. Reconnaissance & Service Enumeration

Nmap Command Used:
nmap -sS -sV -O <target-ip>

Key Findings:

Port | Service | Version
-----|---------|-----------
22   | SSH     | OpenSSH
80   | HTTP    | Apache2

Observation:
The Apache web server hosts DVWA, intentionally configured with low security settings.

---

## 4. Identified Vulnerabilities

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- CSRF
- Weak Authentication
- File Inclusion

---

## 5. Business Impact

Successful exploitation can result in:

- Database compromise
- Credential theft
- Remote code execution
- Full server compromise

---

## 6. Conclusion

The Ubuntu-hosted DVWA application demonstrates how insecure web development practices can directly impact server security.
