## 1. Simulation Overview

Detail                | Description
----------------------|-------------------------------------
Attack Type           | Phishing Simulation
Target                | DVWA Users
Environment           | Controlled Lab
Risk Severity         | High

Objective:
Demonstrate how user credentials can be harvested using cloned login interfaces.

## 2. Simulation Setup

- Cloned DVWA login page
- Hosted on local Kali server
- Captured submitted credentials

---

## 3. Attack Flow

1. Victim receives malicious link
2. Victim enters credentials
3. Credentials captured
4. Attacker logs into real DVWA instance

---

## 4. Impact

- Account compromise
- Privilege escalation
- Unauthorized access to application data
