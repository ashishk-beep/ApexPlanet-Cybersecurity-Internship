# ApexPlanet-Cybersecurity-Internship
This repository contains my work, notes, and deliverables for the  
**60-Day Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship** at  
**ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.**

📅 **Duration:** January – March 2026  

The internship is designed to build strong foundations in cybersecurity and progress toward hands-on penetration testing, system security, and incident response through guided tasks and lab-based learning.
