# Lab Setup Summary

A controlled virtual lab environment was created to safely perform
cybersecurity learning and testing activities as part of Task-1. Kali
Linux was used as the attacker machine due to its built-in security and
penetration testing tools, while DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
was used as the vulnerable target application for practicing web security
concepts.

Metasploitable2 was not used because it is an x86-based virtual machine
and is not compatible with ARM-based systems such as Apple Silicon when
using VMware Fusion. To ensure compatibility and successful lab
execution, DVWA was selected as the target environment.

The attacker and target systems were connected using a private network (Host-Only)
configuration to maintain isolation from external networks. Network
connectivity was verified to ensure proper communication between the
systems. This lab setup provides a safe and authorized environment for
practicing cybersecurity fundamentals and tool-based security testing.
