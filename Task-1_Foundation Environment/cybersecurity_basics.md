# Cybersecurity Basics

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems,
networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft.
With the rapid growth of digital systems, cybersecurity has become a
critical requirement for organizations and individuals.

## CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the core principle of cybersecurity:

### Confidentiality
Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.
Examples include encryption, authentication, and access controls.

### Integrity
Ensures that data is accurate and has not been altered by unauthorized users.
Hashing and checksums help maintain integrity.

### Availability
Ensures that systems and data are available when required.
Techniques include backups, redundancy, and protection against DDoS attacks.

## Importance of Cybersecurity
- Protects personal and organizational data
- Prevents financial loss
- Maintains trust in digital systems





# Cyber Threat Types

Cyber threats are malicious activities aimed at damaging or gaining
unauthorized access to systems and data.

## Common Threats

### Phishing
A social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing
credentials or sensitive information via fake emails or websites.

### Malware
Malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware that
damage systems or steal data.

### DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
An attack that floods a target system with excessive traffic, making it
unavailable to legitimate users.

### SQL Injection
An attack that exploits vulnerable database queries to read or manipulate
database data.

### Brute Force Attack
An attack where passwords are guessed repeatedly until the correct one is found.






# Attack Vectors

Attack vectors are the methods or pathways used by attackers to gain
unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data. Understanding attack
vectors helps organizations identify weak points and apply appropriate
security controls.

Attackers often combine multiple attack vectors to successfully
compromise a target.

## Common Attack Vectors

### 1. Social Engineering
Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical
vulnerabilities. Attackers manipulate users into revealing sensitive
information such as passwords or clicking malicious links.

Examples:
- Phishing emails
- Fake login pages
- Impersonation attacks

---

### 2. Insider Threats
Insider threats originate from individuals within an organization who
have authorized access to systems. These attacks can be intentional or
accidental.

Examples:
- Disgruntled employees stealing data
- Employees misconfiguring systems
- Sharing credentials with unauthorized users

---

### 3. Web Application Attack Vectors
Web applications are common targets due to insecure coding practices.

Examples:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- File Inclusion vulnerabilities

These attacks can lead to data breaches and unauthorized system access.

---

### 4. Network-Based Attack Vectors
Attackers exploit weaknesses in network configurations and protocols.

Examples:
- Open ports and misconfigured services
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
Packet sniffing on unsecured networks

---

### 5. Wireless Attack Vectors
Wireless networks can be targeted if not properly secured.

Examples:
- Weak Wi-Fi passwords
- Unencrypted wireless traffic
- Rogue access points

## Importance of Understanding Attack Vectors

- Helps identify system weaknesses
- Improves defensive security planning
- Assists in threat modeling and risk assessment
- Enables better incident response preparation
