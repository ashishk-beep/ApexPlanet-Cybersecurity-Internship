# Tools Familiarization

Tool familiarization is an important part of cybersecurity training.
Understanding the purpose and basic usage of commonly used security tools
helps in network analysis, vulnerability identification, and web
application testing. In this task, basic exposure to widely used security
tools was performed to understand their role in practical cybersecurity
environments.

The tools used and their purposes are summarized below:

- **Wireshark** is used for capturing and analyzing network traffic in
  real time. It helps inspect protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and DNS, and
  assists in identifying unencrypted traffic and suspicious network
  activity during troubleshooting and traffic analysis.

- **Nmap (Network Mapper)** is used for network scanning to discover live
  hosts, open ports, and running services on a target system. It is
  commonly used during the reconnaissance phase to understand network
  exposure and service availability. A basic scan can be performed using:
  `nmap <target-ip>`.

- **Burp Suite** is used for web application security testing by
  intercepting and analyzing HTTP and HTTPS traffic between a browser and
  a web server. It helps in understanding how web applications handle user
  input, requests, and responses, which is essential for identifying
  security weaknesses.

- **Netcat** is a versatile networking tool used to read and write
  network data, test open ports, and establish simple client-server
  connections. It is commonly used for basic network testing and
  troubleshooting. A simple connection can be tested using:
  `nc <target-ip> <port>`.

Overall, familiarity with tools such as Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, and
Netcat provides a strong foundation for practical cybersecurity tasks.
These tools are essential for analyzing networks, testing applications,
and understanding system behavior in controlled security environments.
